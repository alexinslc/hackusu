    <h2>About hackUSU</h2>
    <p>hackUSU is a student group on campus at Utah State University laser focused on tech.</p>
    <p>We are challenging students across campus to <span class="text-info">do more</span> than attend classes, do assignments, rinse and repeat.
      <span class="text-info">Become a hacker, create a website, app, game, or hardware project.</span>
    </p>
    <h3>Our Mission</h3>
    <p>
      hackUSU is <a href="https://medium.com/@gum_ina_package/bringing-hacker-culture-to-purdue-2aa2072e2833">bringing the hacker culture</a> to our campus, community, and state.
    </p>
    <h3>What is hacking?</h3>
    <p>No we aren't breaking in to anything. To us, hacking means creating, innovating, and building something awesome with software or hardware.</p>
    <h3>I can't code, can I still join?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! If you have a passion for all things tech, this is the place for you. We also have CodeWeekends coming up to teach you how to code!</p>
